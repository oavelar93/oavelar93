Ansible is tool used to help manage your environment. Ansible allows you to automate your server setup and configuration so that it can be relaunched to the exact specifications that you provided within the script (or a "playbook"). AWS allows you to use Ansible to manage your EC2 Instances as well, and you can execute several Ansible Playbooks through SSH to your Instances as soon as they are available to use. In order for AWS to communicate with Ansible, it m ust be installed through Amazon CLI. Once you have installed CLI, you must install Ansible, Python3, and boto. Ansible can now be used to manipulate instances. Playbooks have a very consistent and simple syntax for configurations, beginning with a dash ("-") for new sections and colons to seperate Units from Values.

Security Groups must be managed appropriately, since AWS Security Groups are Stateful meaning traffic can be allowed in with the proper IP. Ansible Playbook files can be saved as a .yml file extension and the file must be run with the tags to be created properly.
