Spot Instances really are a great addition to the huge list of services AWS has to offer! They allow you to minimize costs or set other standards to better tailor to your personal needs for your server. While On Demand Instances can be a little more practical or reliable depending on your circumstance, they ultimately can be configured to surpass these shortcomings. Cloudwatch is a log repository service for AWS that can be configured to listen to the logs of your EC2 instance and trigger a certain set of steps to do what you need it to do.

For this project I am tasked with congifuring Cloudwatch to read the logs from the current running EC2 Spot Instance for State Change Notifications. Once a 2-minute server shutdown warning is received by the instance, Cloudwatch automatically triggers a Lambda Function that will create a new EC2 instance using a prebaked AMI in another availability Zone before the old instance is shutdown. It will also be create a bastion in a public subnet and route ssh traffic to the proper Instance. All ELB functions should be automatically set as well. If we are successful, our project will be used directly within CSUNs current infrastructure!
