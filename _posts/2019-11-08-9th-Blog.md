I have continued to struggle to understand and find documentation regarding how to code the terraform for Route 53. I have more or less figured out the resource blocks I will need my issue is more understanding how to correctly enter the information for Terraform to interpret and install. I was able to figure out the type A record for the IP of the Instance but thats about it. Hopefully I will learn enough tomorrow in class to get this finished!
