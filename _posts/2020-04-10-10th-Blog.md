Google Sites is an easy to use drag and drop website development tool offered by google. They do have various limitation to how the look as well as work though, as some important tools are left out such as 3rd party extension capability or CSS editing. Where Google Sites is able to shine though is it's very easy to use web editor tool. It is almost completely seemless to go from empty webpage to a top notch website in no time. And where 3rd party integrations are lacking, there is javascript form embeding. There is obviously the ability to change your domain name and set permissions for the different collaborators on your site. MEnu capabilities as well as header and footer options are very simple and limited. 
They have also added the ability to add a shoping page, although it also has some limitiations. Overall, Google Sites is a great option for a beginner level web designer or just someone who needs a landing page for people. Theprice ranging for Sites is actually free as well. So all a new user has to do is create an account, regsiter their domain on Google Domains, and customize their site!
