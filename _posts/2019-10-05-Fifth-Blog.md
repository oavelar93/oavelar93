This Fifth week of class we were assigned with creating a web server on AWS Services. We named our Group Git Legion and I went ahead nad purchased the domain name from google domains. I now have to setup the domain using amazon route 53 which I will be doing this week. As a student of CSUN we receive a 100 dollar credit so I had to register my account to receive the credit. We also set up the github repository which we will use to host the site.
