The 4th week was an extension of the 3rd week of class, my group was finally able to program two .yml files to install traceroute and ansible automatically as a container in any docker command line when the proper .conf files are included. I also began the next lab that centers around properly installing prometheus. I am stuck on something involving wget but I'm sure I'll figure it out soon. Overall a pretty challenging but also satisfying week.
