Wordpress is a Content Management System that originally began as a simple blog creation website but soon grew to include various web development tools such as plugins, templates, mailing lists and even membership functionality. To put it in simple terms, Wordpress is now the largest web development tool in use, with over 33% of web pages built with Wordpress. All that is needed to use it is a Domain Name and a hosting platform. Everything else can be created using WordPress.

The main focal point of WordPress is its Website Themes which there are thousands of. All Sites must have a theme installed but they can be manipulated in many different ways. Plugins are the part of WordPress that allows it to be user friendly for an amatuer developer. Plugins can range from shop functionality to chat functionality to securty and even Search ENgine Optimization. Some Plugins may be more useful than others however, and may not even be functional with your installed version of WordPress. The overall experience needed to navigate WordPress can be very polarizing though, and even something simple may require you to do alot of prgraming research to be able to resolve. It's current working version as of today is 5.4 Nicknamed "Adderley".
