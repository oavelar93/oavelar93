This week of school we continued to try to figure out the EC2 instance of our AWS Server. It turns out our instance wasn't made to accept Ubuntu commands so my classmate created another instance with the correct OS and was able to get the ansible playbook to install everything properly. I was also finally able to apply the correct CNAME info to the Route 53 DNS Management section weith the new server CNAME information.  Class was cancelled for tomorrow though, so we will have to present next week.
