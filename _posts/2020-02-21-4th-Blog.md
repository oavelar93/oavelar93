AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management) is an dedicated account security service for Amazon accounts or services. This also allows for the separation of people using the same Amazon account. Within IAM theres exists Groups, Users, Roles and Policies. Users for example can be placed into groups to be given permissions. Groups can be created and Permissions can be assigned to those groups, allowing for users to be placed. Users are automatically created with No Permissions. User accounts should be created including for you as the root user.

Access types must be specified when creating the accounts and then they must be placed in groups. individual permissions can be attached to a new user but generally best practice is obviously to just use groups. Users can be given as little permission as simple read access or up to full access to all Services and Security levels.


Roles may also be assigned to actual Amazon Services. Allowing them permissions to retrieve or use other Amazon Services. Services by default do not have permission to interact with each other and they must also be assigned.
