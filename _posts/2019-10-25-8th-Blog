This week we learned a few things about our upcoming project. mainly how to use Terraform. We began by getting everything installed. I installed pip3 on my local machine and then used it to download and install ansible and terraform. From there I was able to get AWS CLI installed by just using their installation method. Pretty simple. From there we began to work on the EC2 instance and the Virtual Private Cloud. i will work on my load Balancer portion soon!
