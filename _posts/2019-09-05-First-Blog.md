This week I had a great time learning about how to create a simple, static website on github using Jekyll. This process began with creating a Github account and then creating my first repository, titled oavelar93. After installing Ruby and using it to install Jekyll, I cloned my repository from Github and accessed the directory before initializing it. After that I used a 3rd party software called Jeklog to help create my first static site. Overall a pretty good experience!
