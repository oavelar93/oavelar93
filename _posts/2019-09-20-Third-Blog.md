This week was had a surprising turn when we installed a container manually and were then given the task of installing the container with a single dockerfile. After creating the dockerfile with a docker build command followed by a -f (designating filepath). I began my docker containter by stating the base OS as ubuntu and then updating/upgrading it.All yes flags needed to be set as well in order for the commands to work. I have not had a chance to make sure it works but I will be sure to do so by tomorrow!
