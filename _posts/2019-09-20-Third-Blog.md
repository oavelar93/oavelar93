We were introduced to ansible this week, which was a little hard to wrap my head around. What I've concluded so far is that it is a tool that allows you to build containers using very simple keywords such as apt: which installs the program you are hoping to install and writes the proper metadata for it. THwre is also a service: keyword which gives the script the abillity to launch the service you have previously installed. the last keyword that I found to be very interesting was that of git: which fetched a webpage for the user when invoked. Overall i'd say a pretty confusing week but hopefully I will continue to reach a better understanding before we turn it in
